## How to run the Jupyter notebooks

To be able to run the two notebooks, Python needs to be installed. The requirements file lists additional packages not included with the standard Python installation. 

1. Download and install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html)
2. Access the command line interface (for example using [Cmder](https://cmder.net/) or the Windows Command Prompt)
3. Navigate to the file folder and run `jupyter lab`. The notebooks will typically open in the standard web browser.
